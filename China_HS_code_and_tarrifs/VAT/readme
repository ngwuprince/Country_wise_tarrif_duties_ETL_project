# HS Code & VAT Rate Scraper

A Python script that automates the extraction of **HS Codes** (Harmonized System Codes) and their corresponding **Import VAT Rates** from [TransCustoms](https://www.transcustoms.com).

## Features
- Extracts 4-digit HS headings from the HS Code tree
- Scrapes all 10-digit HS codes for each heading (with pagination support)
- Retrieves VAT rates for each HS code
- Exports results to a structured CSV file
- Built-in error handling and rate-limiting

## Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
   ```

## Usage

The script is divided into three logical components:

### 1. Extract HS Headings (4-digit)
```python
# Cell 1: Extract HS Headings
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re

url = "https://www.transcustoms.com/HS_tree.htm"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
hs_headings = sorted(list(set(re.findall(r'Heading (\d{4}):', soup.get_text()))))
print(f"Extracted {len(hs_headings)} unique HS Headings")
```

### 2. Scrape 10-digit HS Codes
```python
# Cell 2: Scrape All HS Codes
def scrape_hs_codes(heading, max_pages=4):
    """Scrapes HS codes for a given heading across multiple pages"""
    # Implementation here
```

### 3. Fetch VAT Rates
```python
# Cell 3: Fetch VAT Rates
def fetch_vat_rate(hs_code):
    """Retrieves VAT rate for a single HS code"""
    # Implementation here
```

Run each cell sequentially to:
1. Get all HS headings
2. Find all 10-digit HS codes
3. Retrieve VAT rates and export to CSV

## Output

The final output will be saved as `hs_codes_vat_rates.csv` with the following structure:

| HS_Code      | VAT_Rate |
|--------------|----------|
| 0101210010   | 13%      |
| 0101210090   | 9%       |

## Legal Considerations
- Always check [robots.txt](https://www.transcustoms.com/robots.txt) before scraping
- Add delays between requests (`sleep(1)`) to avoid overloading servers
