# HS Code & VAT Rate Scraper

A Python script that automates the extraction of **HS Codes** (Harmonized System Codes) and their corresponding **Import VAT Rates** from [TransCustoms](https://www.transcustoms.com).

## Features
- Extracts 4-digit HS headings from the HS Code tree
- Scrapes all 10-digit HS codes for each heading (with pagination support)
- Retrieves VAT rates for each HS code
- Exports results to a structured CSV file


- Install dependencies:
   
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

Below is a detailed explanation of the code design:

1. Imports and Setup:
    - `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
    - `BeautifulSoup`: Used for parsing HTML content.
    - `re`: Used for regular expressions to find specific patterns in text.
    - `sleep`: Used to delay execution to avoid rate-limiting (commented out).
    - `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and exporting data to CSV.

2. Fetching and Parsing the Initial Web Page:
    
    - The code fetches the webpage containing HS headings and parses the HTML.
    - It extracts all text from the page and uses a regular expression to find patterns like "Heading XXXX".
    - The HS headings are deduplicated and sorted.

3. Function to Scrape HS Codes for Each Heading:

    - This function scrapes HS codes for a given heading across multiple pages (up to 4).
    - It constructs the URL for each page, fetches it, and parses the HTML.
    - It uses a regular expression to find 10-digit HS codes and adds them to a set to avoid duplicates.

4. Scraping All HS Codes for Each Heading:
    - This loop iterates over each unique HS heading, scrapes HS codes, and prints the results.
    - It accumulates all HS codes and deduplicates them.

5. Function to Fetch VAT Rate for a Single HS Code:
    - This function fetches the VAT rate for a single HS code.
    - It constructs the URL for the HS code, fetches it, and parses the HTML.
    - It searches for a specific label ("Import VAT (Value-Added Tax)") and retrieves the corresponding VAT rate.

6. Scraping VAT Rates for All HS Codes:
    - This loop iterates over each unique HS code, fetches the VAT rate, and prints the results.
    - It accumulates the results in a list of dictionaries.

7. **Exporting Results to CSV**:
    - The results are converted to a pandas DataFrame and exported to a CSV file.

### Summary
The code's design involves:
- Fetching and parsing initial data to get HS headings.
- Scraping detailed HS codes for each heading.
- Fetching VAT rates for each HS code.
- Collecting and exporting the results to a CSV file.
